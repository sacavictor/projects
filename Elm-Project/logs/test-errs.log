-- UNEXPECTED SYMBOL - C:\Users\User\Documents\pf\Elm-Project\src\Model\Post.elm

I am getting stuck because this line starts with the { symbol:

35| {-| Decoder for the `Post` type. -}
    ^
When a line has no spaces at the beginning, I expect it to be a declaration like
one of these:

    greet : String -> String
    greet name =
      "Hello " ++ name ++ "!"
    
    type User = Anonymous | LoggedIn String

If this is not supposed to be a declaration, try adding some spaces before it?

`elm make` failed with exit code 1.
